            <h2>Track Organization</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>To start, create a new PTX from the template titled: "YYMMDD Artist Title - Song Title".</p>
                    <p>Then import all the audio and make sure all tracks are descriptively labeled. "Kick in"/"K",
                        "Rm", "Long Verb", "LngVb", "Sn Plate","Ld Gtr" ,etc., are perfectly acceptable.</p>
                        <p>If we were given a PTX, at minimum let's import the audio tracks from the PTX. If the routing and organization of the original PTX is good, we can use some of their busses. This will have to be case-by-case.</p>
                        
                </li>
                    <li>Bonus: please put multiple takes of a source in a playlist. Some projects do not come in as PTX and each take is just a wav file from a big mess in a folder. </li>
            
                <li>Color coding: 
                    <br>Please use these brightness levels out of Pro Tools 3 vertical rows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Busses and Ld Vocals: Top row (brightest)</li>
                        <li>Other audio source tracks: Middle row</li>
                        <li>FX, Delays, Triggers: Bottom row (darkest)</li>
                    </ul> 
                    
                    Please follow this color coding and place the tracks in this order:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drums: Red</li>
                        <li>Drum Bus goes here. Brightest Red.</li>
                        <li>Bass: Orange</li>
                        <li>Guitars: Green </li>
                        <li>If both acoustic guitars and electric guitars, push electric guitars towards a yellow-green and the
                            acoustics towards lime green.</li>
                        <li>Synths: Sky Blue</li>
                        <li>Horns: Yellow</li>
                        <li>Band Bus goes here. I like bright blue.</li>
                        <li>Vocals: Pink for leads, purple for harmonies. <i>Use top row pink for lead despite following notes about
                                color brightness. Lead doubles should be middle row of the same pink.</i></li>
                        <li>Vocal FX go here. Darkest purple.</li>
                        <li>Vocal Bus goes here. Bright purple.</li>
                        <li>Mix Bus</li>
                        <li>Producers/Tracking Mix: Grey (none)</li>
                        <li>Reference Mixes: Grey</li>
                        <li>VCAs go here, color coded per the food group they represent.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Bussing/Groups</h2>
            <ul>
             <li>Multi-mic'd sources should go to their own (edit/mix) group.</li>
             <li>Then I like to create up to 8 "food group" VCAs, typically drums, basses, guitars, synths, lead vocals, backing vocals, vocal fx, etc.,</li>
             <li>(Place VCAs at the very very end of the session)</li>
             <li>Everything that isn't a vocal or vocal effect goes to the BAND bus.</li>
             <li>Everything that is a vocal or vocal related should go to the VOCAL bus.</li>
             <li>Only the BAND and VOCAL busses should go to the MIX bus. Everything should be in one of those two busses before hitting the MIX.</li>
             <li><strong>I like to have busses after the tracks feeding them.</strong> So general track order would be a pile of drum tracks, then DRUM BUS, then a pile of instruments, BAND BUS, a pile of vocals, vocal effects, VOCAL BUS, MIX BUS, MONITOR MASTER</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Editing:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>First, make a new or duplicate playlist. Leave all the source material in playlists. Sometimes I like to reference the unedited material to handle a mix note.</li>
                <li>Comp and time edit as much as the song requires. Some genres lend themselves well to lots of comping, some do not.</li>
                <li>Chop out extraneous noises in takes.</li>
                <li>Please use RX De-noise, De-click, vocal de-noise, etc., to repair <strong> just the trouble spots through audiosuite, commiting the plugin.</strong></li>
                <li>Melodyne as much as required. Please commit melodyne to a new playlist.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Last steps:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Save the PTX as YYMMDD Artist Name - Project Name (PREP). <i>Some exceptions apply. I will let you know if so.</i></li>
                <li>Deliver PTX and committed melodyne audio.</li> 
            </ul>
