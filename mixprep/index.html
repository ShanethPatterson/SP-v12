            <h2>Track Organization</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>To start, import the mix template that provides a few utilities</p>
                    <p>Then import all the audio and make sure all tracks are descriptively labeled. "Kick in"/"K",
                        "Rm", "Long Verb", "LngVb", "Sn Plate","Ld Gtr" ,etc., are perfectly acceptable.</p>
                        <p>If we were given a PTX, at minimum let's import the audio tracks from the PTX. If the routing and organization of the original PTX is good, we can use some of their busses. This will have to be case-by-case.</p>
                        
                </li>
                <li> Bonus: use the comments box to write any committed processing, or information I need to know about the content
                    of playlists.</li>
                    <li>Another bonus: please put multiple takes of a source in a playlist. Some projects do not come in as PTX and each take is just a wav file from a big mess in a folder. </li>
            
                <li>Color coding: 
                    <br>Please use these brightness levels out of Pro Tools 3 vertical rows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Busses and Ld Vocals: Top row (brightest)</li>
                        <li>Other audio source tracks: Middle row</li>
                        <li>FX, Delays, Triggers: Bottom row (darkest)</li>
                    </ul> 
                    
                    Please follow this color coding and place the tracks in this general order:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drums: Red</li>
                        <li>Drum Bus goes here. Brightest Red.</li>
                        <li>Bass: Orange</li>
                        <li>Guitars: Green </li>
                        <li>If both acoustic guitars and electric guitars, push electric guitars towards a yellow-green and the
                            acoustics towards lime green.</li>
                        <li>Synths: Sky Blue</li>
                        <li>Horns: Yellow</li>
                        <li>Band Bus goes here. I like bright blue.</li>
                        <li>Vocals: Pink for leads, purple for harmonies. <i>Use top row pink for lead despite following notes about
                                color brightness. Lead doubles should be middle row of the same pink.</i></li>
                        <li>Vocal FX go here. Darkest purple.</li>
                        <li>Vocal Bus goes here. Bright purple.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Bussing</h2>
            <ul>
             <li>Drums go to the drum bus. If its a live drum kit with phase-relative muliple mics, please put those mics in an edit group. No VCA needed in this case.</li>
             <li>Multi-mic'd sources or more than 4 channels per instrument should go to their own (edit/mix if phase locked) mix group with a VCA fader just for organization sake. Examples are a pile of rhythm guitar tracks by the same performer getting a mix group with VCA, multiple mics on a lead guitar solo getting an edit/mix group with VCA, a bynch of synths getting a mix group with VCA.</li>
             <li>Everything that isn't a vocal or vocal effect goes to the BAND bus.</li>
             <li>Everything that is a vocal or vocal related should go to the VOCAL bus.</li>
             <li>Send the ld vocals to all 5 vocal effect auxes. Don't worry about backing vocals.</li>
             <li>Only the BAND and VOCAL busses should go to the MIX bus. Everything should be in one of those two busses before hitting the MIX.</li>
             <li><strong>I like to have busses after the tracks feeding them.</strong> So general track order would be a pile of drum tracks, then DRUM BUS, then a pile of instruments, BAND BUS, a pile of vocals, vocal effects, VOCAL BUS, MIX BUS, MONITOR MASTER</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Editing:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>First, make a new or duplicate playlist. Leave all the source material in playlists. Sometimes I like to reference the unedited material to handle a mix note.</li>
                <li>Comp and time edit as much as the song requires. Some genres lend themselves well to lots of comping, some do not.</li>
                <li>Please use RX De-noise, De-click, vocal de-noise, etc., to repair <strong> just the trouble spots through audiosuite, commiting the plugin.</strong></li>
                <li>Melodyne as much as required. Please commit melodyne to a new playlist.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Last steps:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Drop all audio track faders to -inf (silent).</li>
                <li>Export the PTX as YYMMDD Client Name - Project Name. <i>Some exceptions apply. I will let you know if so.</i></li>
                <li>I will provide cloud space to deliver PTXs.</li> 
            </ul>
